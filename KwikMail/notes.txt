Adding new ui elements:
    * packages have a menu sub that receives the menu structure and can add elements
    * packages define a window
    * packages receive the shortcut key structure
        * structure is a hash keyed by package name that the shortcut applies to
        * special key '_main' applies to all windows
        * special key 'SELF' applies to this UI element (transformed into package name)

Dev notes:
    * I have to have the View drive the Model, rather than vis-versa, because the *real*
      controller is actually Curses::UI. In MVC the controller handles input, changes the
      model, and a model update changes the view.
